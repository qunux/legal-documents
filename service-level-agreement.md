##### An Industry Leading SLA

We aim to provide a 99.9% service uptime, excluding planned or emergency server maintenance or conditions beyond our reasonable control. All customers will be notified of planned maintenance as far as possible in advance through our [status page](https://status.qunux.com) and, should the maintenance last for longer than 30 minutes, via e-mail.

Should we break this SLA in any calendar month with unscheduled service unavailability (as verified by our network monitoring) we will upon request credit a full week's cost to your client account. No hidden catches - we value our service and clients extremely highly.

Our SLA is rescinded if you have overdue invoices on your account, or if you have paid the invoice for the period of the disruption late.

Qunux makes no guarantee to defend a customer's website from a denial of service attack unless such service has been specifically offered and agreed.

##### For Virtual Private, Dedicated and Custom Hosting Platform Customers

On our virtual servers, dedicated servers and custom hosting platform, our SLA is increased as follows:

We guarantee that in the remote event of a server hardware failure that cannot be fixed, the hardware will be replaced within five hours of the problem's diagnosis.

It does not include any bespoke server hosting solutions. Our parts and labour warranty covers all parts and labour costs involved in the event of a related parts failure. Any failed component shall be replaced by us at no cost to you.

In the event of a problem with your server, we shall ensure that a qualified engineer will be dealing with the problem within 15 minutes of being notified. In the rare event that your problem cannot be resolved within 15 minutes you will be notified. When notifying you we will provide you with the details of the problem along with an estimation of when the issue will be resolved. We shall keep you regularly updated until the moment the problem is resolved. An engineer's report shall be sent to you within 12 hours of the problem being resolved. We will reboot your servers (physically or remotely) 24 hours a day without any cost to you.
